		üëã Hi there! I'm Chris, a blend of creativity and tech-savvy, hailing from the vibrant streets
		of Memphis, TN, and now rooted in the eclectic vibes of Jacksonville, FL. My journey has taken
		me through the sunny shores of California, the historic landscapes of Virginia, and the peachy
		realms of Georgia.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a kid, I found joy in illustration and painting, a passion that naturally led me to the world
		of computers and technology. This dual interest brought me to The Art Institute at Jacksonville,
		where I earned my BA in Graphic Design. Now, I'm part of the Dalton Agency family, where my days
		are filled with a mix of IT, graphic design, and primarily web development. My work involves
		collaborating with a range of clients, from local businesses to notable names like the Mayo
		Clinic and Zoo Atlanta.
	</p>

	<p>
		But what really drives me? It's the joy of creation and the excitement of continuous learning.
		I've always been the one to quietly observe, soak in details, and then bring ideas to life with
		dedication and precision. Whether it's a complex web project or a simple design task, I approach
		it with the same level of enthusiasm and commitment.
	</p>

	<p>
		My career journey wasn't a straight shot to where I am today. It included various roles, from
		retail jobs as a teenager to commercial and residential painting while pursuing my studies. It
		was at Bluwave Productions where I discovered a deeper interest in web development. I created
		digital interactive ads for Comcast Spotlight's customers using Flash. RIPüôè This interest
		blossomed at Dalton Agency, where I've had the opportunity to dive into diverse web projects,
		constantly expanding my skills and knowledge.
	</p>

	<p>
		Away from the screen, I'm a builder at heart. My hobbies - woodworking, interior design, 3D
		printing, and painting - are all about creating and bringing ideas to life. This builder's
		mindset extends beyond hobbies; it's a core part of who I am, both professionally and
		personally.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm a man of few words, often the quiet one in the room, but always ready to lend a hand or
		offer a thoughtful solution. I value hard work, organization, and a keen attention to detail in
		all aspects of life.
	</p>

	<p>
		Joining me in my journey is my wonderful partner of over a decade and our two dogs,a Husky named
		Mogley (No, he doesn't howl or ‚Äútalk‚Äù he's quite like his papa) and a Jack Russell/Chihuahua mix
		named Little, affectionately known as the Fart Squad. We're the adventurous kind, always ready
		to pack our bags and explore new corners of the world, learning and experiencing as much as we
		can.
	</p>

	<p>
		As I look ahead, my goal is to merge my technical skills with my creative vision in an
		environment that values innovation and forward-thinking. I'm excited about the possibilities
		that lie ahead in web development and design, and I'm eager to contribute to projects that are
		not only challenging but also make a meaningful impact.
	</p>

	<p>
		Welcome to my little corner of the internet - a space where creativity meets technology, and
		every project is a new adventure.
